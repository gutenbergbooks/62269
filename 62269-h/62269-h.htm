EVERYWHERE STRANGERS: EVERYWHERE AT HOME. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you want to find a Gypsy the
police are more likely to be able to give you his address than
directories, bankers, or ministers of religion; and it was a
Liverpool policeman who sent me to the back of the municipal
slaughter-house to seek a horde of &ldquo;Hungarian&rdquo;
<i>Roms</i> whose arrival had been announced by the evening
papers.&nbsp; In a squalid street, at a corner where insanitary
dwellings had been demolished, I found a vacant plot of
brick-strewn ground surrounded by high walls.&nbsp; There,
evidently, were my Gypsies, for a crowd of boys had gathered
round the one door, struggling for a glance through its
keyhole.&nbsp; Mistaking me for a detective, they made way, and I
knocked loudly and long.</p>
<p>The boys were not mistaken.&nbsp; There was a scene within
which was worth looking at.&nbsp; The strangers had journeyed so
rapidly from Marseilles <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>to Liverpool that they had outstripped
their heavy baggage, and, arriving before their tents, were
obliged to bivouac under tiny extemporized shelters propped
against the windowless house-walls which formed two sides of the
square.&nbsp; They were making the best of circumstances with
considerable success, for they had with them countless beds of
eiderdown in brilliantly coloured covers, and they had their
all-important samovars.&nbsp; The men were out, but the women,
protected by a police-serjeant from the inhospitable attentions
of their neighbours, were in the camp, and into that shabby yard
they had brought an unaccustomed glory which was altogether
foreign and oriental.</p>
<p>He who stepped through the battered door in St. Andrew Street
travelled fifteen hundred miles in a second.&nbsp; Without, the
slaughter-house and slums&mdash;dull, drab Liverpool; within, the
glorious East&mdash;strange dark faces of exotic beauty, a blaze
of scarlet gowns and yellow gold.&nbsp; For the women were
bedizened with much jewellery: rings shone on their fingers,
barbaric bracelets on their arms, chains and corals dangled from
their necks, heavy pendants <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>from their ears, and on their blouses
sparkled many trinkets and brooches.&nbsp; Their jet-black hair
hung in two plaits over their shoulders, and in each plait was
woven a cord to which were attached six or seven great gold
medals, generally Continental coins of 100 francs, but often our
own magnificent five-pound pieces.&nbsp; And everywhere children
gambolled&mdash;pictures of health and happiness, fawn-like
creatures whose scanty shifts scarcely concealed their lithe
brown bodies.</p>
<p>Centuries ago man&rsquo;s inhumanity taught Gypsies the lesson
that language is given them for the purpose of concealing their
thoughts, and even now a Gypsy invitation, especially if it be
pressing and cordial, often proves to have been a device for
preventing a second visit.&nbsp; I was assured that carts had
been ordered for seven o&rsquo;clock to effect the removal of the
band to two houses they had rented in Pitt Street.&nbsp; Wishing
to see the flitting, I returned earlier than the time stated,
found that they had departed at six, tracked them with
difficulty, and overtook them, not in Pitt Street, but on the
Landing-stage, awaiting the Birkenhead luggage-boat.&nbsp; At the
head of the procession <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>was a large tilted cart in which
squatted all the women and children, from elderly and angular
Mothers of Egypt to beautiful Vola, the chief&rsquo;s
daughter-in-law, carrying her little baby.&nbsp; Two waggons
followed, loaded with luggage, over which, high piled, was the
bedding, and on top of all, dressed in the costume of theatrical
brigands, the black-bearded men carrying long staves elaborately
decorated with silver.</p>
<p>There were full forty souls in the party, but when the boat
arrived at Birkenhead, Kola, the chief, held up the traffic by
engaging the ticket-collector in an altercation as to the exact
number.&nbsp; Since he spoke in Russian and the official in
English, neither convinced the other.&nbsp; The chief maintained
that there were only fourteen; the collector set the figure
considerably higher, but as no two of his repeated attempts at
enumeration agreed with one another, while the chiefs estimate
never varied, Kola may be said to have had, on the whole, the
best of the argument.&nbsp; At all events the management
preferred giving way to being detained all night, and Uncle Kola
triumphantly led his procession up the bridge.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Meanwhile
a spectator passing along Green Lane, Tranmere, might have seen a
very curious spectacle in the English Gypsies&rsquo; camp, for
that was the destination of the aliens.&nbsp; On a bare patch of
cindery earth between the dark brown tents of the Boswells and
Robinsons, a piece of carpet had been spread, and on it, as
advanced guard awaiting the main body, sat portly Tinka, the
chief&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Cross-legged, motionless, aloof, her
eyes fixed on a distant infinity, quite alone yet totally
unconcerned, she smoked her cigarette calmly in a long meerschaum
holder.&nbsp; Red-robed as ever, wearing an immense weight of
solid gold, brilliant as a flame, she contrasted strangely with
the dingy colouring of the place: a Chinese idol in a Methodist
chapel would have been less incongruous.&nbsp; But the English
Gypsies, aping her detachment, feigned absence of interest; no
one was visible&mdash;nevertheless many an eye was eagerly
pressed to a hole in the tent-blanket.</p>
<p>This invasion by foreign Gypsies was not relished by the old
inhabitants of the pitch, and they threatened to drive the aliens
out.&nbsp; But the aliens neither valued popularity nor feared
the <i>Sinte</i>, as they contemptuously called their <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>British
brethren; with scarce a glance towards, or a thought of, their
neighbours, they went diligently to work to make themselves
comfortable.&nbsp; First they removed, without permission, all
the carts from stables near the camp, and set them, shafts in
air, to make shelters for the night, one for each family.&nbsp;
Then, needing coke, and brooms, and water, and other necessaries,
they turned to the despised <i>Sinte</i> and borrowed what they
required from them.&nbsp; And then the English Gypsy women fell
in love with Vola&rsquo;s baby, and the English Gypsy men were
impressed by Kola&rsquo;s size and ability, and the gorgeous
display of gold touched a responsive chord in all their
hearts.&nbsp; And so in an incredibly short space of time the
strangers became completely at home.</p>

IMPERIUM IN IMPERIO. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> kinds of foreigner tread the
streets of Liverpool, and thus, when Uncle Kola and his tribe
appeared on the banks of the Mersey from nowhere in particular
the little boys put him down as a new species of
&ldquo;Dago,&rdquo; and did not embarrass him with unwelcome
attention.&nbsp; Yet Kola is an extraordinary man, and even his
costume is conspicuous.&nbsp; His trousers, superfluously baggy
and decorated with wide stripes of bright green and red, are
thrust into great top-boots elaborately stitched.&nbsp; The
complicated braiding of his dark blue coat and waistcoat would be
remarkable were it not eclipsed by the glory of his enormous
buttons, splendid examples of the silversmith&rsquo;s
craft.&nbsp; Kola is tall and powerfully built, and he wears his
finery with effect, supporting himself by a five-foot staff
almost covered with silver, on which shine countless little
images of Buddha.&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>His keen eye, aquiline nose, strong
mouth, and venerable beard tinged with grey make derision
impossible; and he walked our thoroughfares with dignity, slowly,
gravely scrutinizing the town as if it owed him money.</p>
<p>And Kola intended that it should&mdash;before he left
it.&nbsp; That was why he had come.&nbsp; He was already rich;
his pockets contained bank-notes which he could have exchanged
anywhere for several hundred golden sovereigns, and his relations
believe that he is worth &pound;30,000.&nbsp; On great occasions
he can decorate his table, which stands only fourteen inches
high, with lordly plate; a silver samovar weighing twenty-three
pounds is matched by a huge salver and an immense bucket of the
same precious metal decorated in high relief.&nbsp; The weight of
solid gold which his wife carries in her hair, on her blouse, and
round her neck and wrists is nothing less than royal.&nbsp; Kola
is, in fact, a ruler; and, if the citizens of Liverpool took but
little interest in him and his subjects, he reciprocated their
contempt, regarding them simply as so many more or less stupid
persons who were destined to provide for him and his tribe what
they were then seeking&mdash;copper pots to mend.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Kola is
suave and courtly, and if you had asked him what were his name
and nationality he would have replied at once that he was Nicolas
Tshoron, a Caucasian, Russian, Ruthenian, Galitsian, or
Hungarian.&nbsp; He has now removed his kingdom to Brazil, and if
you were to follow him across the Atlantic and repeat the
question it is probable that he would elect to call himself
Italian, French, or English.&nbsp; He may be all of these if a
short period of residence is sufficient qualification; but,
though he knows it not, Rumania has stronger claims to him, and
India stronger claims still.&nbsp; Sitting on the carpeted floor
of his great pedimental tent, surrounded by his family and
connexions, you would have found that he is really Worsho, son of
Grantsha, and that he is a Gypsy.&nbsp; Not, of course, exactly
the kind we know; he would call our Gypsies scornfully
<i>Sinte</i>, and claim that he and his tribe alone are the
<i>Roma</i>.&nbsp; Intellectually he is a giant.&nbsp; In the
morning his subjects would set out to solicit orders, returning
despondently as night fell with empty hands or single pans on
their shoulders.&nbsp; But Kola would march triumphantly to the
camp followed by a lorry heavily laden with cauldrons he had
collected <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>for repair.&nbsp; It was Kola who directed the work, and
when any special difficulty arose it was he who sat down and
overcame it.&nbsp; He was completely illiterate; yet he used a
complicated form of contract which he dictated and his patrons
wrote and signed.&nbsp; It concealed artfully the extortionate
charges he proposed to make, and hoodwinked not only the
authorities of a great political club but even those of a
municipal kitchen.&nbsp; And it was Kola who faced the indignant
customer who came to protest against the charge, and either
browbeat him into submission or put him into court.</p>
<p>The craft of the Gypsies was magnificent, and they wielded
their hammers sensitively, as if there were nerve-endings in the
heads.&nbsp; They were admittedly more skilful than British
coppersmiths, ready to undertake and execute successfully work
that would elsewhere be refused as impossible.&nbsp; But their
ideas of remuneration were grandiose, and in a country where
bargaining is a neglected science they retained an oriental habit
of demanding ten times as much as they were prepared to
accept.&nbsp; It mattered not if his customers were
offended&mdash;Kola never intended to see them again.&nbsp; And
so he and <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>his subjects spent a few weeks in each town collecting
work, a few weeks in doing it, and a few turbulent and glorious
weeks in exacting payment.&nbsp; Then they shook the dust from
off the soles of their feet, and departed for ever from the city
they had exhausted.</p>
<p>Kola&rsquo;s policy is successful; it has made him rich.&nbsp;
Other Gypsies have attached themselves to his family, married his
relations, and placed him at the head of an important tribe,
whose activities he regulates, whose well-being he cares for,
whose movements he directs, which he governs as
&ldquo;king.&rdquo;&nbsp; When dissatisfaction arises the
malcontents are free to migrate to another monarchy; but so long
as Kola is successful and so long as his subjects share his
success, thus long will his kingdom endure.</p>
<p>Kola&rsquo;s kingdom should be impossible.&nbsp; It is
contrary to reason, contrary at all events to what we call
reason, that a community should prefer the primitive ways of the
Middle Ages to the latest improvements of modern
civilization.&nbsp; His bellows were old-fashioned even in the
fifteenth century and survive now only among savages; yet in his
eyes they are still the best bellows, and if out of curiosity he
were to <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>purchase a mechanical blower he would probably hand it
over to his grandchildren for a toy.&nbsp; With pockets well
lined with money he neglects to buy table cutlery, tears his
portion of bread from the loaf and scrapes it clumsily in the
butter-dish.&nbsp; The luxurious chairs and sofas with which he
furnishes his royal tent are vain ostentation; guests may use
them, but Kola himself prefers to sit, as his ancestors have sat
for countless centuries, cross-legged on the ground.&nbsp; Us and
all that we value, with the single exception of money, he
despises even more cordially than we despise him.&nbsp; Like a
drop of oil in a glass of water he and his tribe live in our
midst untouched, strangely aloof and alien, a wonderful spectacle
of an <i>Imperium in Imperio</i>.</p>

href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> commercial traveller is more
truly born to his profession than the poet, unless an
unreasonably exacting definition of poet be accepted; and to
those who are not thus born, it seems inexplicable that any sane
person should willingly adopt so toilsome and disagreeable, yet
thankless and inglorious, an occupation, and even learn to like
it.&nbsp; Paradoxically the Gypsy coppersmiths, in travelling,
combined the methods of a raw apprentice, foredoomed to failure,
with diligence, enthusiasm&mdash;and success&mdash;which proved
them born bagmen.&nbsp; They evidently enjoyed being &ldquo;on
the road&rdquo; in this very un-Gypsylike sense; yet, Gypsylike,
retained their independence, differing from the common
&ldquo;drummer&rdquo; in that they represented, not an exacting
master, but their own still more exacting selves.&nbsp; The fact
that they travelled was not remarkable&mdash;travelling was the
necessary prelude to their industry.&nbsp; What was <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>astonishing
was the versatility which enabled them both to beat our native
coppersmiths in smithcraft and to rival British agents in the
energy with which they canvassed for the orders they were
themselves to execute.</p>
<p>With patience anybody can become a fairly good commercial
traveller who has a respectable appearance and good address,
carries a useful article, and asks a reasonable price.&nbsp; The
Gypsies certainly carried a useful article, inasmuch as their
repairs were skilful and thorough, but all the other
circumstances were against them.&nbsp; Their extravagant costume
reminded those on whom they called of brigands rather than of
sober business-men, and brigands are not welcome in offices or
factories.&nbsp; In combination with their black hair and
glittering eyes it was apt to betray their nationality.&nbsp; If
it did, so much the worse, for a commercial transaction with a
Gypsy is several degrees more unpopular than a commercial
transaction with a Jew.</p>
<p>As for address, it mattered not at first whether they
possessed it or not, for they spoke no English.&nbsp; They soon
discovered and engaged threadbare ungrammatical aliens to talk
for <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>them,
but until they obtained such assistance they were content to
carry tattered scraps of soiled paper on which their
qualifications were set forth in a handwriting and dialect which
were very far from commanding the respect of possible
customers.&nbsp; Here again they reared an unnecessary obstacle
against their own success, for it is an axiom that the worse the
business, the better must be the quality of the stationery.&nbsp;
Even when they had learned a little English&mdash;and, belying
Gypsy reputation, they learnt it very slowly&mdash;they scorned
to use ingratiating behaviour, delicate compliment, or even funny
stories; their whole persuasive stock-in-trade was a whine, a
dogged and irritating perseverance, inability to recognize the
moment when it is more profitable to go than to stay, and
stone-deafness to the most emphatic &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
short, their method was simply the endless importunity which
their wives and children devoted to shameless and successful
begging.</p>
<p>It is easy to give goods away; only an expert bagman can get a
high price.&nbsp; Price is the real criterion of the
traveller.&nbsp; In this respect the Gypsies were nothing if not
ambitious, for they set out with the intention of <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>exacting
remuneration so exorbitant that their repairs often cost more
than a pot new from the maker.&nbsp; Thus their only practicable
policy was to conceal carefully the sum they proposed to ask, and
escape at all costs from the danger of giving the estimate which
was always demanded.&nbsp; The form of their contract was
ingeniously designed to serve this purpose, and they also
attempted to disarm natural suspicion by offering to
mend&mdash;or insisting on mending, for they were very
masterful&mdash;the first article for nothing as a proof of their
skill.&nbsp; The latter device was generally unsuccessful, for in
Great Britain the offer of something for nothing, or the pretence
that it is work, not wages, that is wanted, is apt rather to
increase than diminish mistrust.&nbsp; Moreover their conduct was
in other respects far from reassuring.&nbsp; When the owner of a
pot, wearied by their persistence and, if convinced of nothing
else, convinced at least that his only hope of getting back to
business lay in surrender, had resolved reluctantly to entrust
the vessel to their care, they would reawaken his slumbering
suspicions by suggesting that he would require surety for its
safe return.&nbsp; And the unhappy man was obliged to <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>postpone his
relief from torture, and set his tired wits to work devising
non-committal receipts for gold coins and foreign bank-notes in
the genuineness of which he very shrewdly disbelieved.</p>
<p>The deposit was part of a game which the Gypsies refused to
play otherwise than by rule.&nbsp; And so humble Worsho Kokoiesko
would fish out the single gold piece which represented all his
fortune which his wife did not wear, and the great Kola would
brandish bundles of French notes in the face of his victim.&nbsp;
Kola was accustomed&mdash;perhaps wisely&mdash;to flaunt his
wealth, but some of his relations who were also well-to-do used
professions of poverty as arguments when soliciting work.&nbsp;
To their strangely illogical minds simulated indigence was not
inconsistent with the exhibition of large sums of money.&nbsp; I
have myself assisted, as dragoman, in their negotiations with an
important manufacturer of jam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;that we are Hungarian coppersmiths.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This I did, without serious scruples, adding at their command,
and with a clear conscience, that their work was excellent.&nbsp;
To their next instructions, &ldquo;Tell him that our wives are
starving and our <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>children crying for bread,&rdquo; I was inclined to
demur, but was sternly overruled.&nbsp; The jam-manufacturer was
visibly affected, and pity for these strangers within our
inhospitable gates appeared for a moment in his face.&nbsp; But
only for a moment; hurriedly thrusting a bundle covered with red
silk into my hands, the Gypsies added: &ldquo;Show him this; tell
him not to be afraid to trust us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as I untied
the knots twenty great yellow coins appeared&mdash;&pound;80 in
solid gold!</p>
<p>No less conspicuous than their want of finesse was their want
of organization.&nbsp; They neither divided the city into
districts to parcel them out among their members, nor even the
users of copper vessels into classes.&nbsp; Collecting addresses
from strangers they met casually, they visited factories and
institutions at random, wasting much time in long tramps from one
extreme end of the town to the other and then immediately back to
the first district.&nbsp; Lucky the man who discovered a new,
unvisited manufactory; a courteous reception and patient hearing
were generally given him.&nbsp; The patience of most
manufacturers had been early exhausted by the repeated and
lengthy invasions of other members <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of the tribe, and they were in no
mood for further interviews.&nbsp; Some of the more enterprising
and wealthy Gypsies seemed to realize this, for they made
expensive journeys from Birkenhead to Manchester, Leeds, and even
the Isle of Man.&nbsp; The disappointingly small results would
have disheartened an ordinary commercial traveller, but the
Gypsies were anything but ordinary travellers.&nbsp; And
gradually their patience was rewarded, and the camp became
littered with cauldrons and pots awaiting repair, striking
evidence of the almost miraculous power of sheer, unreasoning
tenacity.</p>

20</span>4.&nbsp; THE TALE OF A TUB.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Milanko</span>, son of Yono, was an
impertinent lad, but good-humoured, rather ugly and always
grinning.&nbsp; I had assured him repeatedly that in the
sugar-refinery to which I have the misfortune to be attached all
the &ldquo;pots&rdquo; were as big as houses and in perfect
repair, so that to my deep regret I was unable to take advantage
of the offer of his professional services.&nbsp; Milanko,
however, with the incredulity of an habitual liar, made an
independent reconnaissance through a window and caught sight of
an ancient copper tub, some six feet in diameter and about a
quarter of a ton in weight.&nbsp; Moreover he ascertained, by
means best known to himself, that it was cracked and patched; and
I was weak enough to admit, under his searching
cross-examination, that it would be an advantage to have its
inner surface coated with tin.&nbsp; It was a huge vessel, but
Milanko was ambitious, and thereafter called regularly at
inconvenient hours to present a series of <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>petitions:
first, for the order to mend and tin the pan; second, for the
loan of a pound to purchase solder; third, for half a sovereign
to get boots; fourth, for five shillings to buy a hat; and fifth,
for three pence, the price of a packet of cigarettes.&nbsp; He
accepted the emphatic refusal of his larger requests
philosophically and without resentment.&nbsp; To the last I gave
a favourable hearing, even at our first interview, and we parted
with a friendly exchange of <i>Zha Devlesa</i> (Go with God) and
<i>Ash Devlesa</i> (Remain with God), well understanding that a
second rehearsal was ordered for the morrow and that it would be
succeeded by daily performances.&nbsp; The play had not a long
run.&nbsp; One ill-starred afternoon I granted the main petition,
and the cauldron was carted to Birkenhead to be deposited in the
camp.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Gypsies&rsquo; policy was always to do as
much work as possible, and generally far more than their customer
expected or required, I sent the chief engineer to Green Lane to
make plain to them that the vessel was only to be tinned, and
that the cracks and patches were to be left unmended.&nbsp; No
contract was signed, though there was a distinct verbal <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>agreement
that the cost was to be one pound.&nbsp; I was, however, prepared
to pay as much as three, the price for which a Liverpool firm had
offered to do the same work, because I recognized that the pan
was large and heavy and was interested to see how the
coppersmiths would handle it without either blocks and tackle or
large fires.&nbsp; To my great disappointment I was allowed to
see nothing.&nbsp; When I visited the camp the cauldron was
always discreetly covered with a sheet, and the Gypsies found
ingenious means to keep me and it as far apart as possible.&nbsp;
But occasionally they would draw me aside and expatiate
alarmingly on the amount of tin, acid and labour that were
needed, and, ignoring their estimate, talk tentatively of forty
pounds as a just and probable charge.</p>
<p>At last, one morning, a messenger arrived to report that the
cauldron was ready for delivery, and on the afternoon of the same
day the chief engineer, instructed that he might pay three pounds
but not a penny more, took with him a cart and crossed the river
to Birkenhead.&nbsp; He found the pan turned upside down on the
cindery ground of the camp and proposed to remove it to the
refinery in order <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>that the quality of the work might be examined.&nbsp;
But the Gypsies, holding that possession is nine-tenths of the
law, refused to permit the removal before payment was made.&nbsp;
The wisdom of their decision became evident when bargaining
began, for the engineer offered one pound while they, with fierce
indignation, demanded twenty-five, making the sum unmistakably
clear by placing a sovereign on the pan and indicating the
numeral by means of their outstretched fingers.&nbsp; The
discrepancy between claim and tender was too wide for easy or
rapid adjustment, and neither side showed any willingness to
compromise.&nbsp; The engineer, accustomed to dealing with
Orientals, stuck to his terms, but finding the Gypsies equally
stubborn and much noisier, and convinced as tea-time approached
that no settlement was then possible, he ordered the cart back to
Liverpool and himself withdrew from the conference.</p>
<p>And then the Gypsies made a false step.&nbsp; The engineer had
scarcely settled down to his evening meal when, to his amazement,
word was sent from the refinery that the cauldron and the
coppersmiths were at the gate.&nbsp; They had changed their
minds, hastened to overtake <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the cart aboard the luggage-boat, and
persuaded the carter to return to the tents and bring the pan
away.&nbsp; The office being closed when they arrived, settlement
of their little account was out of the question, and, obliged to
surrender the only security they had for payment, they could but
protest loudly and depart with an invitation to call again the
next day.</p>
<p>Other duties kept me away from business, and I was not a
spectator of their visit.&nbsp; But I heard afterwards long,
eloquent and indignant stories of how Milanko, apparelled like a
mountebank, with his father and the deformed dwarf Burda or
Morkosh, his cousin&rsquo;s husband, dared to profane the
solemnity of the counting-house, a sanctuary where the cumulative
respectability of five generations of sugar-boilers is devoutly
worshipped.&nbsp; Never during the whole course of its long
business experience had that chamber entertained guests so
unwelcome.&nbsp; They arrived at ten in the morning and stayed
until half-past two, demanding payment from the cashier and
relenting gradually from twenty-five to seven pounds, less than
which they long refused to accept.&nbsp; Nobody knew what to do
with them&mdash;the situation was <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>unprecedented.&nbsp; When tired of
standing and worrying busy clerks with the question
&ldquo;Master, what you do now?&rdquo; they scandalized the whole
staff by sitting cross-legged on the floor.&nbsp; It was a
contest of endurance; and, thanks to the definite orders I had
left, we won.&nbsp; Just as the problem of what was to happen at
closing time, if they were still in possession, was becoming
insistent, the Gypsies gave way, accepted three pounds and
retired, after desecrating the office for four hours and a
half.</p>
<p>It would have been absurd to expect Kola&rsquo;s disciples to
rest content with a reasonable reward, and indeed they often
begged for supplementary payments.&nbsp; Even the chief&rsquo;s
wife condescended to interest herself in the matter and
complained to me about the character of the engineer&mdash;a bad
man, as she said; and I had to explain that it was partly for
this particular fault of character that we valued him.&nbsp; Yono
never forgave me, but Milanko resumed friendly relationships at
once, and I believe that the tribe in general respected me the
more for my victory.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>5.&nbsp; PARLIAMENTS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> profession of the Gypsies,
according to a reverend Spanish professor, whom Borrow quotes, is
idleness; and by their proverb <i>Butin hi dinilenge</i> (Work is
for fools) the German Gypsies plead guilty to the charge.&nbsp;
In this respect the coppersmiths were exceptional, for among them
diligence raged almost as an epidemic fever.&nbsp; The missionary
of the eight-hours day would not have found a welcome in their
camp, nor the agent of a Sabbath-observance society any
encouragement.&nbsp; On all days of the week, at all hours of the
day, the rhythmic tap of their hammers and the muffled gust of
their bellows preached eloquent sermons on industry, while knots
of busy women, sewing, washing and cooking, gave an equally
striking object-lesson in the same subject.</p>
<p>Nor did they seek to compensate by recreation for long hours
of labour.&nbsp; The young people showed a certain skill in games
like knuckle-bones or pitch-and-toss, and took a <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>slight
interest in boxing and wrestling but seldom practised them.&nbsp;
Only on rare occasions did they and their elders play cards or
visit music-halls, and the gramophones which several families
possessed were little heard.&nbsp; If they danced it was when
there was a prospect of extorting baksheesh from visitors, and
the ill-remembered tales and songs which they sold to collectors
of such curiosities seemed to be rather what they had heard
others tell or sing than what they cherished for their own
amusement.&nbsp; Unlike many of their brethren they were not
entertainers, and they had no strong desire to be themselves
entertained.</p>
<p>Judged from a trade-union point of view, or even from that of
a picture-palace proprietor, this excessive devotion to work
would be regarded as a symptom of savagery; yet, as increasing
productiveness and wealth, it might with equal justice be taken
as a sign of advanced civilization.&nbsp; In one respect,
however, the Gypsies were undoubtedly primitive, and that was in
their faith in parliaments.&nbsp; When day had faded into night
and toil had ceased, if they were not eating their irregular
meals or drinking glasses of tea made in samovars whose <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>hours of work
were scarcely less than their own, the coppersmiths were holding
interminable divans.&nbsp; In wet or cold weather parliament
assembled within a tent; but on warm evenings sessions were held
in the open air, the members sitting in a ring cross-legged on
the ground or lolling on beds of eiderdown.&nbsp; Although the
children were kept at a distance these meetings were not councils
of elders, since the young men as well as the old were
present.&nbsp; Their wives and daughters sat apart engaged in
womanly occupations, for there was in the tribe no need to blow a
&ldquo;trumpet against the monstrous regiment of
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably Kola, the chief, would not have permitted the
constant presence of inquisitive visitors when important matters
were under discussion, or would have changed the subject on their
arrival.&nbsp; In any case to have sat evening after evening, as
it were in the distinguished strangers&rsquo; gallery, listening
to debates which were only half intelligible, was an
entertainment drearier than any of his visitors was prepared to
face.&nbsp; Thus it is impossible to decide whether these
parliaments had legislative and judicial functions, or whether,
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>as
Kola&rsquo;s privy council, they were only deliberative and
advisory.&nbsp; When strangers were present Fardi sometimes
improved the occasion by producing a little ragged map of the
world to question them about the amenities of different
countries.&nbsp; It was a projection after the method of
Mercator, in which Greenland appeared, grossly exaggerated, as an
attractive patch of bright colour equal in size to the whole of
Europe and pleasantly unspotted by the names of icy mountains or
any other geographical complexities.&nbsp; This image of
Greenland had for Fardi the same attraction as the
bellman&rsquo;s chart for the Snark-hunting crew, and he was
convinced only with difficulty that, the climate being
intolerable and the natives poor, he was unlikely to do there a
great trade in mending copper pots.&nbsp; To parliament, too,
Kola exhibited his first large payment in British money, a big
bundle of Bank of England notes.&nbsp; His subjects passed them
from grimy hand to grimy hand, tugged them viciously, held them
up to the light, and then delivered judgment: &ldquo;Ugly notes,
but tough paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussions were as solemn as those of the mother of
parliaments at Westminster, and <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>much more sincere, although they were
neither opened with prayer nor encumbered by any decorative
formalities.&nbsp; If the chief was chairman&mdash;and he
sometimes enthroned himself upon an upturned cauldron&mdash;his
services were seldom required either to keep order, which was
amply secured by the native dignity of the members, or to direct
a debate that had no tendency to stray from the one subject which
was uppermost in all their minds.&nbsp; Generalities that had no
concrete application to their trade did not interest them, and
they would have refused to send a representative to the congress
which was held in Hungary in 1879 to deliberate on the common
interests of Gypsies everywhere.&nbsp; Sometimes when Russians
visited the camp the coppersmiths would listen so eagerly to long
accounts of events in the outside world that it seemed as though
the divan was their newspaper or club, and stood to them in the
same relation as the &ldquo;crack i&rsquo; the kirkyard&rdquo; to
Scottish farm-folk a century ago, or as his favourite
public-house to the British workman.&nbsp; But in truth only
those facts really interested them which affected their work and
industry, and most of what they heard passed in at one ear and
out <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>at the
other.&nbsp; They were greedy for knowledge of the wealth of
nations, the size of cities, or the trades by which towns
prospered; they collected scraps of paper on which chance
acquaintances had scribbled the addresses of factories; and in
fact all their conversation and all their thoughts were concerned
with the problem of work and where to find it.</p>

32</span>6.&nbsp; THE PHOTOGRAPH. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Conversation</span> was difficult, not
because there was nothing to talk about, but because Lotka,
Fardi&rsquo;s comely wife, returned at every opportunity to the
subject of my study carpet.&nbsp; I had invited them to afternoon
tea and they were taking it in my room, behaving with the perfect
propriety Gypsies always observe under circumstances in which the
manners and self-possession of a British workman would
fail.&nbsp; But my carpet was thick and soft, catholic in its
colour-taste though red in the main, and decorated with a large
angular sprawling Indian pattern&mdash;and Lotka had fallen in
love with it.&nbsp; She had proposed to take it up at once and
transfer it to her tent at Tranmere, waiving aside my objected
fear of cold feet with the reply that I could go to bed then and
buy a new one in the morning.&nbsp; All will sympathize <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>with my
eagerness to change the subject who know what serious Gypsy
begging means: it is dangerous as oratory, convincing a man
against his reason, and leading to bitterly repented
sacrifices.&nbsp; But those who have experienced it will know
also the impossibility of escape.&nbsp; Like a skiff in a
whirlpool our talk might seem to be sailing pleasantly North,
South, East or West, and yet be tending inevitably towards the
central peril.&nbsp; No matter what conversational subject was
started it led relentlessly back to the carpet.</p>
<p>Amongst other fruitless devices for escape which ingenuity,
quickened by despair, suggested, was the production of albums of
Gypsy pictures, the leaves of which my guests turned
indifferently, punctuating their talk with contemptuous
exclamations of &ldquo;<i>Sinte</i>&rdquo;&mdash;but the talk was
still of carpets.&nbsp; There were photographs of real Gypsies
from everywhere on earth, engravings of artists&rsquo; Gypsies
such as have never been seen anywhere in the world, highly
coloured illustrations of camps, and ancient woodcuts of the
costume Gypsies wore of old; but none represented &ldquo;Our
<i>Roma</i>&rdquo; and for Fardi and his spouse all were devoid
of any <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>kind of interest.&nbsp; In the middle of a page,
however, was a somewhat mean picture-postcard which had reached
me through several hands, but came originally from Lemberg in
Galitsia.&nbsp; It represented a troop of elaborately costumed
performers, whom I had always taken for &ldquo;counterfeit
Egyptians,&rdquo; dancing and playing huge accordions on an
artistically decorated stage, and the subscription was
&ldquo;Gypsies from the Caucasus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fardi never
allowed his emotions to appear conspicuously, but it was evident
from the close scrutiny he and Lotka made of the postcard that
they were genuinely interested: &ldquo;Our <i>Roma</i>,&rdquo;
they said, approvingly, but without surprise.&nbsp; Then they
gave me the names of some of the party, and apropos of the
stage-drapery, reverted to the subject of carpets.</p>

<p>During the next few days occasional questions showed that my
guests had carried news of the picture to the camp, and that the
tribe hid beneath their affected indifference some curiosity as
to how it came to be in my possession.&nbsp; But I was totally
unprepared for the demonstration of deep concern which the paltry
print was to wring from the great Kola&rsquo;s dignified
wife.&nbsp; Taking me quietly aside she <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>invited me to
sit near her, told me that she had heard about the photograph,
and expressed a desire to see it.&nbsp; I gladly seized the
opportunity to give her a cordial invitation to come with her
husband to tea.&nbsp; Without such an excuse I should not have
dared to suggest a visit; for, absurd as it may seem to those who
do not know these people, I felt instinctively that the chief and
his lady were personages of rank so high that it would have been
presumptuous to ask them to my poor house.&nbsp; My instinct was
probably just, for Tinka refused politely, alleging as excuse the
weakness of her chest.&nbsp; Unwilling to renounce the honour of
entertaining royalty, I offered to take her and the chief by rail
to Liverpool and thence to Alfred Street in a taxicab; and, when
this proposal was rejected, to bring the taxicab to the camp,
cross the river on the luggage-boat, and take them all the way
without change.&nbsp; But Tinka was adamant and demanded that the
book should be brought to the tents.&nbsp; The idea of subjecting
my treasured album to the eager unwashed hands of working
coppersmiths did not commend itself to me, and I replied that the
book was too large and <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>too heavy to bring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tear
the page out&rdquo; she ordered, royally regardless; but I
refused to mutilate the volume.&nbsp; Then she begged, the
queenly Tinka, begged just as Lotka had begged for my
carpet&mdash;earnestly, eloquently, passionately, almost
irresistibly.&nbsp; Hardening my heart to withstand this more
than usually distressing exhibition of skill in the ancient Gypsy
accomplishment, I turned to look at my tormentor&mdash;she was
weeping bitterly!&nbsp; Instead of a typical case of adroit Gypsy
imposture I had found an equally typical case of Gypsy family
affection.&nbsp; With a voice broken by sobs she offered in
exchange for a brief glance at the picture, first a silver plate
a foot in diameter, and then a great gold ring such as she
herself wore.&nbsp; For among those whose portraits appeared on
the card was her brother, and she had not seen him for twenty
years.</p>
<p>Need I add that in my book a blank space, of which I am
prouder than of my rarest Callot, bears witness to-day to the
fact that Tinka had her will?&nbsp; &ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;you have been very hospitable to me.&nbsp; I do not want
your silver plate, I will not take your gold ring; but to-morrow
you shall have the little picture.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>And when I
brought it, framed gaudily, to give it some semblance of a gift
for presentation to royalty, the Gypsies crowded excitedly round,
and Tinka, almost in tears again, raised her proud hands to
Heaven, and called down blessings on my head in showers so
liberal that, if but a tithe be sent, I shall be among the most
fortunate of men.</p>

38</span>7.&nbsp; THE SICK BOY. <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sedateness</span> was characteristic of
the coppersmiths&rsquo; camp.&nbsp; Even when the air
reverberated with the tapping of many hammers there was no
bustle; work went on steadily, certainly, slowly, and with
dignity.&nbsp; The arrival of a stranger was the pretext for an
animated and noisy chorus of begging by the women, but on
ordinary occasions the foreign Gypsies applied themselves
solemnly to labour, or still more solemnly to interminable
divans.&nbsp; Blood-curdling oaths in gentle Romani were hurled
even at the spoiled children when they manifested their spirits
and happiness too noisily; yet among them there was one who was
privileged to be as troublesome as he chose without reproof, and
he was the sick boy.</p>
<p>His exceptional position seemed to have had a malign influence
on his character, for he was not a nice child.&nbsp; With the
want of their robust health he lacked also the sturdy
independence <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>of his playmates.&nbsp; They were self-reliant, forward,
often impertinent, but always lovable&mdash;he was petulant,
fretful, even peevish, and instinctively one pitied rather than
liked him.&nbsp; Yet in all the tribe there was nobody&mdash;man,
woman, or child, from the great chief Kola himself to the
half-naked little ones&mdash;who would have hesitated to make any
effort or any sacrifice by which to mitigate the sick boy&rsquo;s
distress.&nbsp; To his mother he was more than all the
world.&nbsp; She was Zhawzha, the chief&rsquo;s daughter (though
to those who were not of the <i>afici&oacute;n</i>, she would
have called herself Sophie), a strangely pathetic figure in whose
face one could see traces of great beauty marred by bitter
anxiety for her son.&nbsp; Among our first duties as friendly
visitors to the camp were those of acting as her dragoman in the
local surgery and bringing an eminent specialist from Liverpool
to visit the patient.&nbsp; But we discovered gradually not only
that she had consulted other doctors in Birkenhead, but also that
she had prescriptions and drugs, enough to have stocked a
pharmacy, which she had obtained from continental
physicians.&nbsp; And all had prescribed bromides, prohibited
excitement, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>and bidden the distracted mother wait patiently and
hope&mdash;for the boy was epileptic.</p>
<p>He was the one disturbing influence in the tribe, and when the
illness seized him, always suddenly and unexpectedly, frantic
crises of shrill emotion broke the tranquillity of the
camp.&nbsp; From all sides gesticulating women would rush
screaming wildly, and the men would leave their work to return
soon after in gloomy silence bending their heads to an inevitable
fate, while the poor little figure in all the ridiculous bravery
of his gaudy clothes and pale blue plush hat would be carried
under shelter and nursed tenderly.&nbsp; The distracted mother,
meanwhile, would pace the ground, her face distorted with agony,
clutching convulsively at her hair and singing a wild lament; and
even the queenly Tinka would sink to the ashes where she stood,
raise her kindly face to heaven and weep aloud.&nbsp; Such scenes
were frequent and very painful.&nbsp; Even more painful was
one&rsquo;s sense of impotence afterwards, when Zhawzha offered
all she had, even the gold coins from her hair, in exchange for
her boy&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; Time alone could give what she
demanded; but she scorned patience and would not wait.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>No cure
which anybody recommended was left untried, it mattered not what
it was nor how much it cost.&nbsp; And so the child wore amulets,
and to the tent-pole mysterious bunches of thorn-twigs were
tied.&nbsp; But the malady was stubborn, and recourse was had to
quacks who poisoned the little fellow with excessive doses so
that he ceased even to speak, and wandered aimlessly in a
comatose condition.&nbsp; And then, most wonderfully&mdash;for
which of us in our own land could find, at need, a
sorceress?&mdash;they discovered that there was a witch-doctor in
Bradford.&nbsp; Letters were dictated, symptoms described,
medicine bought at exorbitant prices, and Harley Street fees
paid.&nbsp; A lock of hair was cut and sent, untouched by human
hands, for some kind of sympathetic magic.&nbsp; But this, like
everything else, failed to effect the instantaneous cure the
mother demanded, and she and her lad, with his father, a very
black and rather stupid little Gypsy named Adam Kirpatsh,
journeyed to Bradford for a personal interview.</p>
<p>Adam was not wealthy in the same sense as Kola, the chief,
might have been called wealthy; but he had savings, and it was
pitiable to watch him squander them in vain efforts to gratify <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the sick
boy&rsquo;s whims and set the anxious mother&rsquo;s mind at
rest.&nbsp; Protest was useless&mdash;equally useless to urge a
longer trial of rational treatment; he was determined that no
stone should be left unturned.&nbsp; His confidence in the
witch-doctor lasted longer than his faith in any legitimate
practitioner had lasted, but it crumbled away gradually,
undermined by the obvious failure of her treatment.&nbsp; And
then Adam heroically resolved to incur the great expense of
taking his wife and child for a pilgrimage all the way to
Czenstochowa in Russian Poland.&nbsp; The celebrated shrine has
since become notorious, for the dissolute priests robbed the holy
image of its gems; but in July, 1911, it was in high repute among
the Gypsies, and some of them had pictures of the Virgin of
Czenstochowa in their tents.&nbsp; The journey must have been a
trying one for the invalid, but on their way home the family
rested for a while at Berlin, and Adam sent triumphant telegrams
to Birkenhead announcing that the boy was cured.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; As I approached the camp on the occasion of my
first visit after their return, the little lad saw me from a
distance, and ran <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>forward to take my hand.&nbsp; He looked well and happy,
and we walked on gaily towards the tents.&nbsp; But suddenly the
weight on my wrist increased, the child seemed to stumble, and
looking down I saw that he was unconscious.</p>
<p>Misfortune dogged that unhappy family.&nbsp; Poor Zhawzha,
enervated by constant solicitude, died at Mitcham, and was buried
with ceremonies the barbaric extravagance of which was probably
without parallel in this country.&nbsp; There followed unseemly
bickerings about the possession of her property and the custody
of the children, and Adam parted from the band to return to his
own tribe.&nbsp; But it is comforting to know that, whatever may
have happened during these days of grief, whatever sorrows the
future may hold in store, that little afflicted boy will not be
allowed to suffer unnecessarily.&nbsp; May his health be restored
gradually as the years pass!&nbsp; But should fate decree that he
must remain infirm during all the days of his life, it is certain
that the tender care which was lavished on the sick Gypsy by his
warm-hearted compatriots when he was a child will not be
withdrawn when he becomes a grown man.</p>

44</span>8.&nbsp; A GOOD WORK. <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">do</span> not think the old Drill Hall
in Birkenhead has ever been a cheerful place: deserted by the
military and transformed into a boxing booth, it is now
positively dismal.&nbsp; But for two months during the summer of
1911 it was ablaze with Oriental colour.&nbsp; Kola, the Gypsy
chieftain, with his tribe of coppersmiths, had taken possession
of it, having left the English Romany camp at Tranmere to make
room for his brothers, Yantshi and Yishwan, who had arrived from
Marseilles with their wives, children and followers.&nbsp; The
ruling family had established itself upon the high platform where
once bruisers proved their mettle, and from it the royal tenant
looked down a crooked lane bordered on either side by the tents
of his subjects.&nbsp; From irregular skylights in the black roof
dusty, mysterious sunbeams fell upon gay drapery and piles of
eiderdown beds gaudily covered with scarlet and yellow stuff, on
black-bearded <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>men and strange groups of dark women in bright red
dresses loaded with gold, on the little low round tables at which
they sat cross-legged, and on the blue tendrils of smoke that
rose from their brass samovars.&nbsp; In the yard outside was the
din of many hammers beating cauldrons of copper, but it was
almost drowned by a babel of shrill voices quarrelling in a
strange and strongly aspirated tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>For all was not well in Kola&rsquo;s kingdom: disaffection was
brewing, and a schism was imminent.&nbsp; And in the midst of all
the trouble the wife of young Worsho Kokoiesko presented her
husband with a little brown girl, his first child.&nbsp; No
stranger ever knew what secret rites were practised in the
distant corner of the great barn where Worsho, as a poor
relation, lived humbly.&nbsp; Mother and child were screened
carefully from observation, and the first token of the arrival of
a new recruit was the healthy voice of a crying baby.&nbsp; There
was no general rejoicing, no excitement; but Worsho slipped shyly
to my side and, in his rich mellow voice which resembled singing
rather than speaking, invited me to be godfather.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Thus it
happened four days afterwards that I made a morning visit to the
camp ready to add to the solemnity of the occasion such dignity
as a frock-coat and top-hat could lend.&nbsp; Knowing the ancient
and universal Gypsy fondness for baptism I had hoped that there
would have been a tribal festival.&nbsp; It was therefore
disappointing to find that the appearance of the hall was normal,
and that Worsho himself was still in bed, although the time
appointed for the ceremony was near at hand.&nbsp; After some
exhortation he got up, stretched himself, breakfasted leisurely,
and dressed in his ordinary clothes: but Saveta, daughter of
Michael, who was to be godmother, kept me in countenance by
putting on a white dress gaudy with floral patterns.&nbsp; At
last the little procession set out for St. Werburgh&rsquo;s
Church&mdash;the strikingly handsome Worsho, his young widowed
sister Luba, the two godparents, Saveta&rsquo;s pretty little
niece Liza, an assistant librarian from the Bodleian, and the
indispensable baby.</p>
<p>We were shockingly late, and on our arrival found that the
christening ceremony had already begun for the benefit of another
infant.&nbsp; But <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>the good priest left the font, came politely to the door
to receive us, put us in our places, and recommenced the
service.&nbsp; Although unprepared for the solemnity and
thoroughness of my godchild&rsquo;s reception into the Church, I
played my unrehearsed part to the best of my ability, stumbling
only once when, some ancient memory of a grammar school in the
Midlands awaking suddenly at the command, &ldquo;Say the
Paternoster,&rdquo; I said it bravely&mdash;in Latin!&nbsp; And
indeed this fault causes my conscience less trouble than the
problem of how to fulfil my godparental obligations when my
wandering goddaughter may be anywhere at all in either
hemisphere.</p>
<p>All Gypsies have two names, one for public, the other for
private use; and it may be that the baptismal name is the one
they value least.&nbsp; At all events the duty of choosing it
devolved, in this instance, on me, and the parents gave no
indication as to what were their wishes.&nbsp; Unable on the spur
of the moment to remember anything really monumental, I called
the child Saveta after her godmother, and thus she was registered
in the great book when our picturesque little party withdrew to
the sacristy.&nbsp; The <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>mother&rsquo;s name, Anastasi
Fiodorana Shodoro, was also placed on record, the last element
being probably that of the child&rsquo;s maternal
grandfather.&nbsp; But when I began to dictate W-O-R-S-H-O,
Worsho excitedly plucked my sleeve and protested.&nbsp; I had
never heard him called by any other name, and was amazed; but he
produced documents and passports to prove that he was,
officially, Garaz son of Fanaz, the son of Zigano, and as
&ldquo;Garaz Fanaz Zigano&rdquo; he was written down.&nbsp; The
absence of a surname caused no difficulties with our sympathetic
Irish priest; but it was quite otherwise when we paid a necessary
visit to an ignorant registrar.&nbsp; He declared, &ldquo;The man
must have a surname,&rdquo; and regarded the want of so necessary
a distinction as little less serious than the want of a head or
heart.&nbsp; There was a column for surnames in his register, and
it would have been a scandal to leave it empty.&nbsp; We filled
it.</p>
<p>Of all the pleasant recollections associated with this
adventure, one lingers in my memory as especially bright and
comforting.&nbsp; When we left the church the kindly and
venerable Father, who had shepherded us so lovingly through the
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>ceremony,
conducted us courteously to the door, held up his hands in
benediction and exclaimed in a voice that quivered with
sincerity, &ldquo;You have done a good work this day.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>9.&nbsp; THE REVELATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> a year after the arrival of
the coppersmiths, old Grantsha, his sons Fardi, Yantshi and
Yishwan, and his son-in-law Yono, with their wives and children
reappeared in Liverpool, meaning to take ship and follow Kola,
who had already gone to Monte Video.&nbsp; But no boat could be
found to convey them, and after waiting a week in an
emigrants&rsquo; lodging-house in Duke Street, they were obliged
to go by rail to Dover and embark there.&nbsp; It was a gloomy,
undecorated dwelling in which they stayed, a warren of
scantily-furnished rooms, in each of which one family camped like
bears in an overcrowded menagerie.&nbsp; Since there was nothing
else to do, their idle misery found expression in begging.&nbsp;
At home and abroad, in season and out of season, whenever there
was anybody to beg from, they begged immoderately&mdash;all
except Fardi.&nbsp; He and his family were exceptional,
cultivating little courtly airs and holding themselves somewhat
aloof from the rest of the tribe; and in the <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>matter of
respectability the chief himself could hardly hold a candle to
his brother, though they had this in common, that neither ever
begged.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon of the day of their departure with the
coppersmiths.&nbsp; It was a naturally dispiriting afternoon of
steady, drizzling rain, and the conduct of the Gypsies made it
almost insufferably unpleasant.&nbsp; Throughout a long wet
promenade Milanko begged dismally for a silk scarf.&nbsp; A
smaller boy, inspired by a well-founded conviction that I would
give him a cap, accompanied me and a friend when we went home for
afternoon tea.&nbsp; He begged in the streets and at table as
continuously and mechanically as a Chinese praying wheel, refused
food and drink in order that his mouth might be free to exercise
its main function, and afterwards, drenched but undaunted, droned
petitions during half our walk to the station.&nbsp; Yono enticed
me into an apartment on the first floor where he and his family
lived, in order that we might debate at tiresome length a
proposed supplementary payment for tinning the cauldron.&nbsp;
Even Fardi&rsquo;s wife and daughter forgot their manners.&nbsp;
He himself was out, but his women locked the door and removed the
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>key in
order that I might not escape from their room at the top of the
house until Lotka had made a last desperate effort to become
possessor of my carpet.&nbsp; They were interrupted by a loud
knock, and hope rose within me that Fardi had returned and would
exercise parental authority to stop the persecution.&nbsp; But it
was only patient Yono wishing to resume the discussion about the
cauldron.&nbsp; As he came in I went out&mdash;against
resistance, precipitately.&nbsp; Downstairs Grantsha and burly
Yishwan sat in a larger room surrounded by children, while a
group of women stitched industriously at the opposite end.&nbsp;
Every one of them begged.&nbsp; The lads demanded watches,
cigarette-holders and silver match-boxes; even the dotard
Grantsha asked for money; Yishwan&rsquo;s smallest request was
for the coat from off my back; and the girls pleaded singly and
in chorus: &ldquo;Brother, why have you given me
nothing?&rdquo;&nbsp; The attack was irresistible: I was
outnumbered, and the only alternative to surrender was
flight.&nbsp; So I rose to take my leave, assisted to my feet by
two impish boys who, with apparent politeness, seized my hands
and unnoticed by me cleverly stole my silver Zodiac ring.</p>

<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
Gypsies had told me that they would go to Lime Street Station at
seven o&rsquo;clock, and that their train would leave at
half-past eight.&nbsp; Twice before under similar circumstances
they had tried to hoodwink me, and it seemed that they had
tricked me again, for when at half-past seven I reached Lime
Street there was never a gay red skirt to be seen, nor even a
braided coat.&nbsp; Moreover, on inquiry, I learned that no train
for Dover left that or any other Liverpool Station at
eight-thirty.&nbsp; Almost glad to escape a renewal of the
afternoon&rsquo;s hostilities I began to retrace my steps.&nbsp;
I had not walked a couple of hundred yards when, from afar, I
spied a flash of colour so brilliant that it could have been
nothing except a Gypsy girl&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; She was standing
outside the Central Station, where the tribe had assembled to
wait two hours, for their train was scheduled to start at
half-past nine.&nbsp; A microcosm within, yet untouched by, the
greater world, these outlandish people sat perfectly
self-possessed and completely isolated amid a throng of
inquisitive strangers whose presence imported to them as little
as the presence of the vulgar sparrows.&nbsp; They were
adventuring on a journey longer <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>than that which their ancestors
undertook centuries ago when they emigrated from India, yet they
exhibited no greater emotion than if they were changing
parishes.&nbsp; On the platform they had grouped themselves by
families, and behind each group was a hillock of trunks,
utensils, bedding, carpets and tents; but before I reached them
Vasili and another lad met me and, postponing my farewell
interview with the elders, I turned back with the boys to buy
them cigarettes.&nbsp; In the street we found Fardi, and he
accompanied us to a tobacconist.</p>
<p>To my surprise Fardi encouraged the boys not only to choose
the most expensive Russian cigarettes, but also to demand
meerschaum holders.&nbsp; That very afternoon, to distinguish him
above his brethren and mark my approval of the admirable Fardi
who never begged, I had given him as parting present a splendid
guinea pipe; and now he must needs demonstrate that he had gulled
me, that though he had played a long and cunning game of
respectability he was no whit less a Gypsy than the others, and
could, when he chose, beg with the best.&nbsp; My paragon
produced three leather purses which, he said most falsely,
contained all the <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>money he possessed.&nbsp; Two were empty, and in the
third a half-sovereign lurked among some coppers.&nbsp; He begged
for a loan, and, when I refused to entertain the idea, entreated
me to buy a dress for his wife.&nbsp; In the window of a shop
which was preparing to close he saw a gloriously green silk
underskirt marked &ldquo;six and eleven&rdquo; which was exactly
what she would like; and I was the more ready to surrender to his
unexpected attack because I had given Lotka nothing.&nbsp; But
when we entered the shop he saw and preferred a long silk scarf
which was attractively festooned upon a rail.&nbsp; I bought it,
congratulating myself secretly that Fardi, being illiterate,
would not notice that its cost was two shillings less than that
of the petticoat.&nbsp; But Fardi&rsquo;s sharp eyes discerned
the price I paid, and immediately he claimed the dress as well,
becoming almost abusive, and telling me plainly that I ought to
be ashamed to refuse so small a favour.&nbsp; It was the
revelation of a new and unsuspected Fardi&mdash;a much less
comfortable character than the Fardi who never begged.</p>
<p>He begged desperately and without a moment&rsquo;s pause until
the train left Liverpool, <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>ably abetted by every member of his
family.&nbsp; Had I yielded Fardi would have won a barren
victory, because the shop was closed and the dress beyond our
reach: but higher principles were at stake&mdash;it was a trial
of strength, and the respect in which the Gypsies held me was
threatened.&nbsp; There were flank attacks by Yishwan, who wanted
my watch, and rear attacks from battalions of boys, whose demands
a universal provider would have been hard pushed to satisfy: but
Lotka&rsquo;s skirt was the main objective, and, meeting all
arguments, talking with marvellous if ungrammatical fluency, and
shouting as loudly as anybody, I held my position without budging
a hair&rsquo;s-breadth.</p>
<p>Even when, with their samovars and eiderdown beds, the whole
party had been packed in the carriages, Fardi stood at a door and
mischievously continued his persecution.&nbsp; But he and the
others bade me a warm farewell, wishing me brilliantly
overwhelming blessings, all except Yono, who angrily rejected my
proffered hand; and as the train steamed out of the station an
impudent little boy waved from a window a grubby fist, on one
finger of which shone my stolen silver ring.</p>

57</span>10.&nbsp; AN UNWRITTEN TONGUE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Plumbers</span>, and even politicians,
think meanly of Gypsies.&nbsp; The <i>Oxford English
Dictionary</i>, apparently regarding them as a species of vermin
rather than a nation, denies them the barren honour which it
awards to Gallovidians, and spells their name with a little
<i>g</i>.&nbsp; As an old witch complained to Lavengro, some very
respectable persons go so far as to &ldquo;grudge the poor people
the speech they talk among themselves,&rdquo; and, like the
magistrate, brand it &ldquo;no language at all, merely a made-up
gibberish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Herne very properly retorted, with
an ironical curtsey: &ldquo;Oh, bless your wisdom, you can tell
us what our language is without understanding it&rdquo;; for to
learn to understand Romani is a far easier task than to trace it
to its sources.</p>
<p>The central mystery of a mysterious race, it is their greatest
treasure, whether, with Borrow, we regard it as a means &ldquo;to
enable habitual breakers of the law to carry on their
consultations <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>with more secrecy,&rdquo; or share the enthusiasm of
scholars who have found in it the most fascinating, yet most
baffling, problem of linguistics.&nbsp; On the language of the
Gypsies one of the greatest philologists wrote two volumes,
containing more than a thousand closely-printed pages, although
he confessed he had never heard it spoken; another devoted eight
years to the gradual publication of a huge quarto which, when
completed, weighed nearly a hundred ounces; and countless humbler
contributors have added their stones to the cairn of learning
under which Romani lies buried.&nbsp; All believed that in this
unwritten tongue, the conversational currency of &ldquo;the most
unfortunate and degraded of beings,&rdquo; lay hid answers to
riddles which have perplexed the learned for five hundred years:
Where was the original home of the Gypsies?&nbsp; When did they
leave it?&nbsp; By what route did they reach Europe?&nbsp; But
the hopes of scholars have been grievously disappointed, and at
the end of a century of diligent gleaning and scientific analysis
the mystery of Gypsy origin is as deep as it was at the
beginning!</p>
<p>Far from being gibberish, Romani is an inflected language
possessing more cases for its <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>noun than did Latin; and it is
Indian, although the Gypsies, true to their reputation, have
begged words with which to supplement their vocabulary from
Persians, Greeks, Slavs and other peoples among whom they have
dwelt.&nbsp; It has been said that &ldquo;the Arabic of the
Bedouin in this century is incomparably more nearly identical
with that of the tribes through whose borders the children of
Israel were led by Moses than is any one of our contemporary
European tongues with its ancestor of the same remote
period.&rdquo;&nbsp; A similar cause has enabled the Gypsies,
ever wandering, separating and reuniting, to resist more
successfully than a sedentary race could have resisted the
gradual changes which ultimately part a language into mutually
incomprehensible dialects.&nbsp; Their speech is an echo which
has reverberated through the centuries, for in it may be heard
ancient Indian forms that have been lost in India itself, and
dearest of all to the philologist, though most perplexing, a
number of words which are almost pure Sanskrit.&nbsp; But if you
ask the linguistic student of the <i>Roma</i> whence they come,
you will receive no reply more definite than a reference to
north-west Hindustan <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and the inhospitable mountains
thereabouts; while for the date of the Gypsy exodus you may
choose at will any period between 300 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> and 1300 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> and find high philological authority
for your choice.</p>
<p>To satisfy, or, better still, to stimulate curiosity about the
language of the &ldquo;Brahmins of the roads,&rdquo; a short
nursery story in the dialect of the coppersmiths is here
reprinted from the pages of the <i>Journal of the Gypsy Lore
Society</i>, by the kind permission of Mr. E. O. Winstedt, to
whom it was dictated by one of Kola&rsquo;s sons-in-law.&nbsp;
Most of the consonants may, without serious error, be pronounced
as in English, <i>r</i> being rolled as in &ldquo;rural,&rdquo;
<i>g</i> hard as in &ldquo;gas,&rdquo; and s unvoiced as in
&ldquo;sago.&rdquo;&nbsp; The symbol <i>zh</i> represents the
French <i>j</i> or the <i>z</i> in English &ldquo;azure,&rdquo;
while <i>sh</i> is the corresponding unvoiced sound in
&ldquo;ash&rdquo;: with <i>t</i> prefixed the latter becomes
<i>tsh</i>, the double sound heard twice in &ldquo;church,&rdquo;
which would be written
<i>tsh&#601;</i>(<i>r</i>)<i>tsh</i>.&nbsp; In Romani the letter
<i>h</i> is often found after <i>p</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>k</i>,
where, except in the mouths of Irish speakers, it is not used in
English.&nbsp; Thus <i>ph</i> and <i>th</i> have not the values
they have in &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; and &ldquo;theology,&rdquo;
nor <i>kh</i> (as in <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Oriental languages) that of the
<i>ch</i> in Scottish &ldquo;loch,&rdquo; but the <i>h</i> must
be sounded after the other consonant: <i>p+h</i>, <i>t+h</i>, and
<i>k+h</i>.&nbsp; The vowels may be pronounced as in Italian, the
additional vowel <i>&#601;</i> representing the vowels in English
&ldquo;but&rdquo; and &ldquo;cur,&rdquo; and the diphthongs
<i>ai</i> and <i>au</i> being similar to the sounds in
&ldquo;aisle&rdquo; and &ldquo;ounce.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vowel in
English &ldquo;law&rdquo; is written <i>aw</i>.&nbsp; For
examples the following words may be taken:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>but</i> (much) as &ldquo;boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>hai</i> (and) as &ldquo;high.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>h&aacute;ide</i>! (come!) as
&ldquo;high-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>koth&eacute;</i> (there) as
&ldquo;coat-hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>le</i> (take) as &ldquo;lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mekl&eacute;</i> (they allowed) as
&ldquo;make-lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>per</i> (belly) as
&ldquo;pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ye</i> (even) as &ldquo;yea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acute accents indicate the stressed syllables and do not
alter the quality of the vowels.&nbsp; They were not marked in
the original, and are added here merely to assist readers and not
as an accurate record of the coppersmiths&rsquo; method of
accentuation.</p>

<h2>THE FOOL AND HIS TWO BROTHERS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were three brothers; two were
wise, and one a fool.&nbsp; And their father died.&nbsp; Now
their father said: &ldquo;I am going to take to my
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he dies, each brother is to come there to
him.&nbsp; And the big brother said: &ldquo;Do you go, foolish
brother, to our father.&rdquo;&nbsp; The foolish brother took a
stick and put it on his shoulder, and went to his father.&nbsp;
And his father got up, and gave him a black hair.&nbsp; Whenever
he cuts it, there will come out of that hair a black horse.</p>
<p>Now the emperor said that whoever climbs up to his daughter in
the house, on horseback, he will give her to that one.&nbsp; And
the big-brother said: &ldquo;Come along, brother, let us see who
will climb up to the girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the fool said:
&ldquo;Let me, brothers, see whether I, too, can get
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his brothers beat him; <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>they did not
let him.&nbsp; And the two brothers took the horses, and off they
went.&nbsp; But the foolish brother took the hair, and there was
made for him a horse from the hair, and off he went.&nbsp; He
overtook his two brothers, he caught them up from behind; and
they asked him: &ldquo;Who are you, man?&rdquo;&nbsp; He is a
hero.&nbsp; And he beats them severely, his brothers; and off he
went to the girl.&nbsp; And he climbed up into the house to the
girl.&nbsp; And he took the girl for himself; and his
father-in-law kissed him, the fool.</p>
<p>And his father-in-law sends his two sons-in-law (the wise
sons-in-law) to kill birds.&nbsp; And the fool came to his
father-in-law, the emperor, and the fool told him to give him a
gun that he too may kill birds.&nbsp; And the fool broke the gun,
and went off with his two brothers-in-law.&nbsp; He was the
third.&nbsp; And his brothers-in-law walked about, whom he
sought, and they did not kill any birds at all.&nbsp; But the
fool killed many birds with the stick, without a gun.&nbsp; And
his brothers-in-law came and saw the birds; and they say to
themselves: &ldquo;The fool has killed many birds, and we have
killed none.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they beg the birds from the fool,
that he <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>should give them to them.&nbsp; And the fool said:
&ldquo;When I cut your bellies with the knife, then will I give
you the birds, and I will tell the emperor that you have killed
the birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he has cut their bellies, he
gives them the birds, and they went home.</p>
<p>And the emperor saw the many birds, and praises his two
sons-in-law.&nbsp; And he asks the fool: &ldquo;Have you killed
none?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the fool tells the emperor: &ldquo;It was
I who killed those birds.&nbsp; You do not believe me?&nbsp; I
cut their bellies with the knife, and gave them the
birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the emperor pulled up their shirts, and
looked at their bellies.&nbsp; The birds are very good.&nbsp; And
the emperor said to his sons-in-law: &ldquo;Silly fellows! why
did they let him cut their bellies?&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
